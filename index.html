      Tea is a high-level language and runtime system <br>
      for automatically selecting and executing valid statistical tests.
   </p>
   Tea aims to lower the barrier for conducting <span class="stand-out">valid, reporducible statistical analyses</span> for novices and experts alike. 
   Tea achieves this by eliciting users' <span class="stand-out">domain knowledge and hypotheses</span> and verifying <span class="stand-out">properties of the data</span> to infer applicable, valid statistical tests.
